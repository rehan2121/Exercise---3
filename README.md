This Python script serves as a basic user credential management tool. Here's a more professional and detailed explanation of its functionality:

User Input: The script first prompts the user to enter their name, email, and password using the input() function. Each piece of information is stored in separate variables (user_name, gmail, and password).
Data Storage: The entered user credentials are saved as tuples (repeat_user_name, repeat_gmail, repeat_password). These tuples store the user's name, email, and password respectively, prefixed with a descriptive string.
User Interaction: The script simulates a scenario where a user might forget their email or password. It prompts the user with queries about whether they have forgotten their email or password using the input() function.
Conditional Handling:
If the user indicates they have forgotten their email (forget_gmail == "Yes"), the script retrieves and prints the saved email (repeat_gmail).
If the user indicates they have not forgotten their email (forget_gmail == "No"), it assures the user that their email is securely stored in the database, emphasizing that it's end-to-end encrypted.
If the user enters an invalid response, the script prints a generic message indicating that the database is operational.
Similarly, the script handles the scenario of forgetting the password in the same manner.
Professional Messaging: The script utilizes professional and reassuring language to communicate with the user, emphasizing the security measures taken to protect their sensitive information.
User Experience: By providing clear prompts and responses, the script enhances the user experience, ensuring that users can easily interact with the system to retrieve their credentials when needed.
Security Awareness: Through mentioning encryption and secure data storage, the script promotes security awareness among users, instilling confidence in the system's ability to safeguard their personal information.
Overall, this script demonstrates a basic implementation of user credential management, showcasing user interaction, conditional handling, and security-conscious messaging.
